# arrayifier
Simple tool that turns text lists into arrays

I needed to generate random first names for a game and no "Random Name" websites (http://listofrandomnames.com/, for example) provide them as an array.

## Usage:

`arrayifier < source filename > < output filename >`

example:
 `arrayifier "namelist.txt" "namearray.txt"`
